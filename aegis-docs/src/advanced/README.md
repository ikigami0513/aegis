# Advanced Topics

This section is for developers who want to understand how Aegis works "under the hood" or who wish to extend the language capabilities using Rust.

We will dive into:

1.  **Architecture**: The difference between the v0.1 Tree-Walk Interpreter and the current v0.2 Bytecode Virtual Machine.
2.  **Native Extensions**: How to write high-performance plugins in Rust (`.dll` / `.so`) and load them into your Aegis scripts.
