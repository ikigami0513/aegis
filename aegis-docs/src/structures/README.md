# Data Structures

Beyond simple numbers and booleans, real-world applications require organizing data into complex structures. Aegis provides three robust built-in structures:

1.  **Lists**: Ordered, dynamic arrays of values.
2.  **Dictionaries**: Key-value mappings (HashMaps).
3.  **Strings**: Immutable sequences of characters with powerful manipulation methods.

These structures are reference types and are managed automatically by the Aegis memory manager.
