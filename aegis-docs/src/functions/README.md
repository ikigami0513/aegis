# Functions &amp; Functional Programming

Functions are the heart of Aegis logic. They are **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

Aegis v0.2 heavily emphasizes **Functional Programming** paradigms alongside imperative code.

This chapter covers:
* **Declarations**: Standard named functions.
* **Lambdas**: Anonymous functions and closures.
* **Decorators**: Modifying function behavior dynamically.
* **Functional Tools**: Processing data with `map`, `filter`, and `for_each`.
