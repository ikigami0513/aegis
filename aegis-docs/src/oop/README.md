# Object-Oriented Programming

Aegis supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help structure larger codebases and model complex data.

The system is Class-based, supporting:
* **Classes**: Blueprints for objects.
* **Instances**: Objects created from classes.
* **Methods**: Functions bound to specific objects using `this`.
* **Composition**: Building complex objects from simpler ones.
