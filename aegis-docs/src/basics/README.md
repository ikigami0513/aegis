# Language Basics

Aegis is designed to be familiar to developers who know C, Java, JavaScript, or Python. It uses a clean, brace-based syntax with optional semicolons.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental building blocks of the language:

* **Variables**: How to store state.
* **Types**: Dynamic vs Gradual typing.
* **Control Flow**: Making decisions and looping (`if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`).
* **Comments**: Documenting your code.
