# Comments

Comments are lines of code ignored by the compiler. They are useful for documenting your code.

## Single Line Comments

Use `//` for single line comments. Everything after the slashes is ignored.

```aegis
var x = 10 // This is a variable
// This entire line is a comment
```

## Block Comments

Use `/*` to start and `*/` to end a block comment. This can span multiple lines.

```aegis
/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It is useful for describing complex logic
    or temporarily disabling a block of code.
*/
var y = 20
```
